## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
Z.score.list<-list()#Creating empty list
for (row in 1: data.set1_size[1]){
  t2<-data.frame(data.set1[row,1], data.set1[row,2:data.set1_size[2]])#Creating tables for each gene across all agents Z-score
  Z.score.list[[row]]<-t2}#Getting it stored as a list
  row.number<-which(data.set1[1:data.set1_size[1],1]== "XPC")#This function will give the row number of the gene we want.
  Z.score.list[row.number]#Here it will display the table of the gene of interest with the Z-score across all agents
  row.number<-which(Reduce(`|`, lapply(c("XPC", "PARP1"), `==`, data.set1[1:data.set1_size[1],1])))#This will be for multiple genes
  Z.score.list[row.number]
